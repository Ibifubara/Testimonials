# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7)

## Overview
# The challenge
Users should be able to: 
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## The process
# Built with:
- - Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

# What I learned:
Prior to this challenge, I had just done a brief study on CSS grid as I didn't know so much about it. Going through frontend mentor's challenge page, I saw something on grid which happens to be this project and I decided to go back to learn more about grid so that I can attempt the challenge. So this challenge was just for me to practice what I had learned and I was able to do just that. 

# Continued development
I'd look into more resources and try out better was to produce cleaner and more functional web pages.
